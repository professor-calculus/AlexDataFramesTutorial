# Alex's dataframe tutorial!

In this tutorial we'll take a quick look at handling ROOT files without using ROOT, and then onto some cool 
plotting stuff.

Running locally: If you have git lfs installed then you'll get the .root file when cloning. However, if not 
then scp from 
<USER>@lxplus.cern.ch:/afs/cern.ch/work/a/atittert/public/delphes.root

Running on Binder: Binder should download the root file automatically, so no need to scp.

Enjoy!
