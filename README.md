# Alex's dataframe tutorial!

In this tutorial we'll take a quick look at handling ROOT files without using ROOT, and then onto some cool 
plotting stuff.

If you have git lfs installed then you'll get the .root file when cloning. However, if not then scp from 
<USER>@lxplus.cern.ch:/afs/cern.ch/work/a/atittert/public/delphes.root

Enjoy!
